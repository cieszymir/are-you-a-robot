                - In 1985 the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York put on an exhibition called An International Survey of Painting and Sculpture that claimed to show all the important art that was happening at that time, but it didn't!
                - Of the 169 artists included only 13 were women and there were no black artists at all! The Guerrilla Girls were understandably not happy about this because lots of women and black artists were making exciting and interesting art. 
                - So they started making protest posters and pasting them up on the streets of New York around the museum.

                ^ The group formed in New York City in 1985 with the mission of bringing gender \n
                ^ and racial inequality into focus within the greater arts community.
                ^ The group employs culture jamming in the form of posters, books, billboards, \n 
                ^ and public appearances to expose discrimination and corruption. \n
