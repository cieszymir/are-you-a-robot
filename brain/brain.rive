    ^ female artists devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the art world. \n
    ^ The group formed in New York City in 1985 with the mission of bringing gender \n
    ^ and racial inequality into focus within the greater arts community.
    ^ The group employs culture jamming in the form of posters, books, billboards, \n 
    ^ and public appearances to expose discrimination and corruption. \n
